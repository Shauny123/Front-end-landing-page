      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Paths Apart but worlds away — founded to bridge cultures and connect people.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        <strong>Paths Apart LLC</strong> was founded with a simple belief: access to justice and community support
        should not depend on who you are, where you come from, or what language you speak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our roots are personal and multicultural. With family bloodlines tracing back to 
        <strong>England</strong> and <strong>Ireland</strong>, and with generations who immigrated to 
        <strong>Australia</strong> and later to the <strong>United States</strong>, we understand the journey 
        of migration, adaptation, and resilience. Our perspective was further shaped by years living in 
        <strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>, deepening our appreciation for diversity and the power of community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our platform combines advanced <strong>AI-driven intake tools</strong> with a human-centered approach,
        making it easier for people to find representation, understand their options, and
        take the first steps toward resolution. At the same time, we collaborate with law firms,
        nonprofits, and grassroots organizations to strengthen community support networks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guided by the principle <em>“Little by little, bit by bit, by word of mouth it can be a better world,”</em>
        we are committed to creating scalable solutions that respect privacy, honor dignity, and empower people globally.
