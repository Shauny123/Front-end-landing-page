        <p>
          ByWordOfMouthLegal.ai is a modern legal intake and lead-generation platform for
          <strong> law firms and legal service providers</strong>. We streamline the first step of
          case evaluation by parsing incoming client information into structured, actionable summaries,
          so attorneys can review potential matters faster and with less duplication of intake steps.
